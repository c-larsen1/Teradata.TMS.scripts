This script can be run on Teradata Nodes, and is used for daily health checks.
It is still a work in progress...

To copy to your local system.

1) cd ~

2) git remote add origin https://github.com/c-larsen1/Teradata.TMS.scripts.git

3) cd Teradata.TMS.scripts

4) copy both files to a folder on your nodes - I use - /home/support/system.health.scripts/

   - system.health.cfg
   - system.health.sh
   
Remember to give script execute wrights.

Please note - these are my scripts and not scripts from Teradata.
